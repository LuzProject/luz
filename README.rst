Luz
---------------------

Luz is a revolutionary build system for Apple Darwin-based systems.

In order to make a new Luz tweak, you can run
    luz gen

This will take you through a wizard to create a new tweak. You can also manually create a LuzBuild file.

Currently, Luz supports two types of 'modules':
1. Tweaks
2. Tools

Support for Preference Bundles, Applications and XPC is planned.

Luz is still in its early stages, so please report any bugs you find.
