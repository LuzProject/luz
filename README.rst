Luz
---------------------
Luz is a next-generation build system for Apple Darwin-based (and soon to be Linux) systems.

Linux systems **will not** work out of the box and currently will be up to you to get operational, if you dare.

Installing
*********************

Installing is incredibly simple and instructions on how to do so can be found at

    [Luz's documentation site.](https://luz.jaiden.dev/en/latest/setup.html)

This will install the latest version of Luz to your system.

Generation
*********************
Luz comes with a built-in generator that can be used to generate a new project::

    luz gen
